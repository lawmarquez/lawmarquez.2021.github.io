			<p> <strong>FAVORITE CMSC SUBJECT (SO FAR): </strong>CMSC 22</p>
			<p>Reason: I enjoyed doing the final project. It made me feel that I am a real programmer. </p>
			<p> <strong>FAVORITE GE SUBJECT (SO FAR): </strong>Ethics 1</p>
			<p>Reason: I appreciated studying the lessons, even though it is a bit philosophical. Among the GEs I have taken, this subject made me grow to become a better person.</p>
			<p> <strong>FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (SO FAR): </strong>Java</p>
			<p>Reason: It is the first OOP programming language that I have learned. I liked the object-oriented approach more than the procedural approach on the other programming languages that I have used in the past. With OOP, I can imagine more how the code is working behind the scenes. </p>
			<p> <strong>FAVORITE FOOD: </strong> Pinakbet</p>
